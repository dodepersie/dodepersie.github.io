		<h3>A little story about me</h3>
		<hr />
			
		First, I bought a computer by my mother in 2009. At that time I only used the computer only to play offline games. Then, I was bought a Modem in 2011 at that time I was still in elementary school and trying to make a blog. In 2011 I started to create a blog, which I named <strong>DODE-XP</strong>, the name was inspired by the legendary blog at that time namely <strong>RIMO-XP</strong> which contained software, games, office, etc.
		<br /><br />
		When I was managing a blog, there was a lot I learned about HTML and CSS, my blog switched platforms from Blogger to Wordpress in 2012, I bought hosting and domain with a total of 120,000 IDR at that time, I bought a domain with the name <strong>DODE-XP.COM</strong>
		<br /><br />
		And in 2011 to 2012 I got a lot of friends because I joined one of the Indonesian Blogger group on Facebook. And at that time, I was also asked by someone to make his blog theme and I made a decent income.
		<br /><br />
		In 2012, <strong>DODE-XP.COM</strong> got a lot of traffics and page views could reach 50,000 traffics and 100,000 page views a day. Then I put up ads on my website and get a decent income, at least it can make my parents happy ^^
		<br /><br />
		In 2013 to 2015 I created a website to share Twitter followers with each other, that's where I got a lot of lessons about PHP and a bit mySQL. And hopefully, until 2020 I still remember HTML, CSS and PHP well.
